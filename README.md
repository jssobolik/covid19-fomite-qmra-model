Project information:

Fomite Model RiskCalc 12.13.21 contains the code for generating fomite-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection risk estimates using the QMRA-generated dose (Fomite Model QMRAFunctions 12.13.21) and a SARS-CoV-1 adapted dose-response model. Within this code you can modulate the infection control interventions (e.g. ventilation level, humidity (high, low), surface disinfection, mask use (yes/no, type), handwashing (yes/no), surface disinfection (yes/no) etc.,). Fomite Model QMRAFunctions 12.13.21 contains the code for estimating the SARS-CoV-2 dose associated with contacting plastic packaging (fomite transmission).

This fomite QMRA model leverages the base model code (see the repository) and has been used to characterize fomite-mediated SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk and risk mitigation strategies to workers in a receiving warehouse coming into contact with potentially contaminated plastic packaging under cold-chain conditions.
